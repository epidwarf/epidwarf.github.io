title: Goblin Royalty
---
My fort, Ker Gedor, has grown to a mountainhome and been blessed with the arrival of royalty.
Unfortunately, the royalty of our civilization - The Silvery Snake-Hammers - is a 1647-year-old goblin queen and due to a known bug, cannot be assigned quarters.

And this is her sleeping on the stairs

It seems I will have her clean up in a nice, warm bath of magma.
